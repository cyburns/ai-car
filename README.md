# Machine Learning, Neural Network Self-Driving Car

Instructions:

To improve the performance of the cars, ensure that you "save" the data of the car that travels the furthest. This will help the cars progressively travel further distances.
Once all the cars have either crashed or stopped moving before encountering an NPC car, reload the page to start a new session.
